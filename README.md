# StickmanMath

**StickmanMath** is an **interactive and engaging educational combat-style Java game** designed to make learning fun for all ages. Players practice arithmetic skills while battling enemies in a dynamic math-based world.

Answer questions correctly to deal damage, earn coins, and progress, all while reinforcing key math skills in addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Built entirely in Java with Eclipse, the game uses CSV files for saving user data and game state. It supports multiple account types: **Student**, **Teacher**, and **Developer**, each offering different gameplay or administrative roles.

Perfect for practicing math, tracking student progress, or just enjoying a creative twist on learning!

## File Structure

> All files are located inside the `Code/` folder. No subdirectories.

#### Source Files

* `main.java`: Entry point of the game.

#### CSV Files (Stored outside the JAR in the same folder)

* `Main_Game_File.csv`: Stores user data (username, password, account type, level progress, item inventory).
* `Classroom.csv`: Teacher and associated students (`Teacher, student1, student2, ...`).
* `equations.csv`: Contains math equations used in gameplay.

#### Assets

* `.png`, `.jpg`: Sprites and UI graphics.
* `.wav`: Background music and sound effects.

---

## Known Issues

* When exported as a `.jar`, all `.csv` files must **remain outside the jar** and be in the **same folder** as the executable.
* CSV files can be manually edited without running the game — this is currently not restricted.

---

## Requirements

* Java JDK 8 or higher
* Cross-platform: works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (as long as Java is installed)

---

## Notes

* Made entirely in **Java** using **Eclipse**.
* Data persistence is handled through **CSV files** (no database).
* Save files are auto-updated but also include a manual **save button** on the main menu.
